SxLab Solar Panel synth schematics

Inspired by the [Rene Schmitz Dronebox synth](https://www.schmitzbits.de/dronebox.html "Rene Schmitz Dronebox synth").

Solar Panel is a light-controlled analog synth designed for noise musicians. It has 18 analog oscillators controlled exclusively with light, making it not just an instrument, but a performative experience, perfect not only for noise sets, but any experimental gigs in general. CV/Audio input expands its potential even further.
